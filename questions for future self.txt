Why do you need to pickle the shows?
Why not just pass the information via the Home proporties?

Why not just add a couple of methods to the Show Class that will load the OnDeck episode properties into Home?

Why not have the service handling opening new GUI's and loading random playlists?
	oh, it does

Why not have the default send the settings used for the playlist or GUI?
	That dictionary can be used to update the existing dictionary, but only items that relate to the playlist and GUI.
	This would require a Settings Handler be spawned on each call of default.
	OR we could have Settings Handler only spawned (and dict sent) if the Default is a clone, otherwise use local Settings.
	This may cause an issue with  manual selection  as it doesnt update automatically???




Passing ListItem instances vs loading everything into Home
	
	passing listitems
	====================

	-- pros --
	lists would be ready to populate
	works with existing GUI


	-- coms --
	unnecessary for random playlist
	does not allow for widgets


	loading into Home
	====================

	-- pros --
	works with widgets (though not in SHOWID form)
	allows for the GUI contents to be automatically updated


	-- cons --
	requires the GUI to retrieve data
