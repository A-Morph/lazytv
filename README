LazyTV is my first coding project. It creates and launches a randomised playlist of the TV episodes. It scans your TV database to identify the last viewed episode for each of your shows, and populates the playlist with the next available episode. Features include: set the number of shows in the playlist; exclude episodes from unwatched series, include multiple episodes of the same show, filter by show name, genre, episode length, and rating; begin playlist with latest unfinished TV episode.
